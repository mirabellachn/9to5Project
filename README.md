# 9to5Project - Stress-Free Parking Solutions

**9to5** is a SwiftUI-based application designed to assist users during peak traffic hours (9 AM – 6 PM) by providing timely reminders and intelligent parking solutions. If the primary parking location (GOP 9) is full, the app seamlessly redirects users to an alternative parking spot (GOP 5) using real-time navigation.
